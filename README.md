# 2024 Free World Collective

### Who are we?

WE are a collective of students from the Yale 2024 graduating class, united under the mission of creating a freer, more beautiful world for ALL. We fight back against systems which seek to limit our imagination and demand that a new world is possible. 

### What does this mean?

To us, a more beautiful world depends on the collective liberation of everyone. We have challenged ourselves to imagine what a liberated world would look like for ourselves and our communities, and listened to others as they described what is needed for theirs. We have created materials that articulate our collective radical imaginations, and we invite you to join us in imagining what it will look like when we are all free.

This means we are in opposition to systems of imperialism, colonialism, the carceral state, and other systems of oppression that seek to divide us. This movement stands against all forms of hate, including but not limited to: racism, homophobia, transphobia, antisemitism, islamophobia, xenophobia, ableism, and other ways in which we are encouraged to divide ourselves.

What are our demands?
As a collective of undergraduates at Yale, we recognize the specific privilege that Yale community members hold in the local community, the nation, and globally, as Yale is a highly respected institution. 

- To this end, we demand that Yale University call for an **IMMEDIATE** ceasefire in Gaza.
- We demand that the Yale Corporation **DISCLOSE** all investments and **DIVEST** from weapons manufacturing, which contributes to the current genocide as well as countless others. Further, we demand that the Yale Corporation **REINVEST** in New Haven.
- We demand that Yale **DROP ALL CHARGES** against Yale and New Haven community members for participating in peaceful protests calling for disclosure and divestment.

As individuals and organizers, we come from histories of resistance, solidarity, and community. As such, we stand with unwavering support with the Land Back movement, Abolition movement, and other global solidarity efforts. 

None of us are free until all of us are free, and we refuse to imagine a free world without each other.

All Power to All People.<br>
Free Palestine. Free the World. 

In solidarity forever,<br>
